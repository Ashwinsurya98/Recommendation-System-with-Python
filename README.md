# Recommendation System with Python
I had used famous MovieLens dataset, which is one of the most common datasets used when implementing and testing recommender engines. It contains 100k movie ratings from 943 users and a selection of 1682 movies.
In this project, I had implemented following RS:-
1)Model-Based CF by using singular value decomposition (SVD)
2)Memory-Based CF by computing cosine similarity. 
3)Content Based RS
